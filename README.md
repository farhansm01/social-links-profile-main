## My process

I started by building the HTML structure of the profile card, including the avatar, user information, and social links. Then I styled each element step by step, focusing on layout, colors, spacing, and interactive states for the buttons. Finally, I tested and adjusted the design to ensure it was responsive and looked good on different screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to make a clean, centered card layout using Flexbox, apply subtle hover and click effects to make buttons feel interactive, and use CSS variables to manage colors and fonts efficiently. I also realized how minimal, thoughtful design can make a layout naturally look good on different screen sizes.

During this project, I learned how to make links feel like clickable buttons using the :active pseudo-class. Even without using <button> elements, I was able to create a subtle “clicky” effect:

```css
.card .link-section a:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- CSS animations and transitions to make interactive elements more engaging.

- Advanced responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid for more complex designs.

- Accessibility improvements, such as better focus states and ARIA attributes for interactive elements.

- Component reuse and modular CSS to make styling more efficient for larger projects.
